First pass at knife-vagrant, a knife plugin that will create a Vagrant box, then run a set of Chef recipes in it.  Right now here's the setup required:

- Virtualbox 4.1.X
- Vagrant (http://vagrantup.com/)
- chef gem install (client only)

Eventually I plan on packaging knife-vagrant as a gem, so the chef and vagrant gems will come along with it.
